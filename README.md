GradCopter
===========

The grads attempt to build a quadrocopter!  What could possibly go wrong?

<strong>GradCopter Is:</strong><br />
Chris: "Just have a swarm of tiny ones, then we can make them fly in an armchair formation."<br />
Bekki: "Autopilots are insane."<br />
Michael: "Yeah, I think to begin with we want something that doesn't explode."<br />
Luke: "I *might* not have suggested a ball bearing payload."<br />
Rich: "I think the real question is, why stop at 4 fans?"<br />
Alena: "Wire to a plug point. Long wire."<br />
Andy: "if propeller.height > room.height: break"<br />
